/*  The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.
The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation,
and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color. You must add the percent sign %
to the saturation and lightness values.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.*/
